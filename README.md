# 🎲 Pig Dice Game  

A fun Python implementation of the classic **Pig Dice Game** for 2–4 players!  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Players take turns rolling a 6-sided die.  
- **Risk/reward mechanic**: Roll again to accumulate points, but rolling a 1 resets your turn score!  
- **Winning condition**: First player to reach `50` points wins.  
- **Input validation**: Ensures valid player count (2–4) and roll choices (`y/n`).  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
- Python (`random` module, loops, conditionals)  

## 🎯 Example  
```plaintext 
Roll? (y): y  
You rolled a: 4  
Current score: 4  
Roll? (y): n  
Total score: 4  

Player 2 wins with a score of 50!
